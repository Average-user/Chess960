# chess-960

A generator of starting positions of
**[Fischer random Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960)**,
also known as **[Chess960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960)**.

Made For people like me who don't like to memorize opening nor
to lose just because of that. Of course there will be positions
in which being white gives you more advantage than usual,
but based on my personal experience of more than 50 games,
most positions are quite fun and balanced.

This is just for generating positions to play
in your own chess board, this does not
support any other user interactions yet.

You can try it **[here](https://average-user.github.io/Chess960/)**
in the gh-pages. But if you don't feel like doing that, this is
how it looks:
